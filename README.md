# Employee Tracker

## Description
This assignment is an advanced NodeJS application utilizing Inquirer, MySQL, and the CLI. Multiple Javascript files were used with schema/query files set up in a modular fashion for ease of access. This resulted in a CLI application used to modify employee, manager, job title, and department data. Below is a link to a video demonstration of the application.
